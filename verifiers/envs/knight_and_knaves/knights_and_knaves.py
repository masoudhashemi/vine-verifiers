    The puzzles are set on a fictional island where all inhabitants are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie.
    The puzzles involve a visitor to the island who meets small groups of inhabitants.
    Usually the aim is for the visitor to deduce the inhabitants' type from their statements, but some puzzles of this type ask for other facts to be deduced.
    The puzzle may also be to determine a yesâ€“no question which the visitor can ask in order to discover a particular piece of information.
